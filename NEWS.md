# NumericEnsembles 0.2.0

# NumericEnsembles 0.1.0

* Initial CRAN submission.

# NumericEnsembles 1.0.0

## Added example of New_Boston data set as a new data set to use in NumericEnsembles ('do_you_have_new_data?')

* To see how this works, use the data as Boston_housing, and the new data as New_Boston.

## Removed neuralnet models since I could not get the RMSE down, added cppls, which creates a much more accurate ensemble compared to the previous version.

## Re-added neuralnet models (individual and ensemble) since I was able to get those to work without error

## Added best subsets: Forward, backward, exhaustive and seqrep
